# Welcome to My Users App
***

## Task
Implement a simple web application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. The application should allow users to create, read, update, and delete user data from an SQLite database. The application should also have a RESTful API that allows users to interact with the data using HTTP requests. Finally, the application should have an HTML view that displays all of the users in a table.

## Description
This project implements the MVC architecture pattern with a User model, SQLite database, and JSON API. It provides CRUD functionality with routes for getting all users, creating users, signing in/out, updating user passwords, and deleting users. Additionally, it includes a simple HTML page for displaying all users.

## Installation
1. Install Ruby and SQLite3.
2. Install required gems with 'bundle install'.
3. Run 'ruby app.rb' to start the server.

## Usage
1. Send HTTP requests to the API routes to interact with the User model.
2. Access the HTML page at the root route to view all users.
